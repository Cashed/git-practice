		<h2>Introduction</h2>
	    	<p>I am excited to be learning about web development.  The internet has always seemed like magic, and while I unlock the secrets, I am still in awe of the power the web has to bring the world together one bit at a time.</p>
	    	<p>My focus lately has been on front-end development with HTML and CSS, such as trying to get the hang of making my site responsive (grr!). Soon I hope to add jQuery and JavaScript to my list of tools. 
	  	<h2>Where I'm From</h2>
	    	<p>Born and raised in Arizona, I am currently living in Washington and loving every bit of it!</p>
	    	<p>"But it rains so much!"</p>  
	    	<p>I think that's what all the locals say to keep more people from discovering this place.  Mild weather, lush forests, and fresh seafood.  Yes, please. </p>
	  	<h2>More About Me</h2>
	  	<ul class="questions">
		    <li>What are your favorite hobbies?</li>
		      <p>I love being in the outdoors hiking, mountain biking, and playing with my dog, Ocho. However, indoor-time is video game time!</p>
		    <li>What's your dream job?</li>
		      <p>My dream job would involve developing apps to help people enjoy nature.</p>
		    <li>What's your background?</li>
		      <p>I have a varied background and have done many things including teaching high school English.</p>
		    <li>What music have you been listening to lately?</li>
		    <p>I have been digging some <a href="http://www.grimesmusic.com/" target="_blank">Grimes</a> lately.</p>
